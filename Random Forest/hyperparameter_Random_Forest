Hyper_Parameters:

    Tuning RF Classifier:
        - n_estimators : Number of Decision Trees in your model to be used
        - max_features : from the no. of features in dataset, how many to use
        - bootstrap    : if True then sampling with replacement else not
        - max_samples  : no. of rows you would give to each decision tree (optimum: 50%-70% of dataset)

    Other hyper_parameters are same as that of decision trees

    Some other parameters:
        - n_jobs       :  parallely train decision trees using multiple cores
        - random_state :  controls randomness of sampling of data (bootstrap) and features (during split)
        - warm_start   :  when to train algo in stages (some data now, some later)
        - class_weight :  when you have imbalanced dataset (less data for some classes), add weights to classes
